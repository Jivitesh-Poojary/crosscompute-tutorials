There's an unspoken agreement that because you're now in a relationship,
your partner "owes" you things -- such as respect, love, or understanding.
Not only that, but they're supposed to know exactly how and when you want or
need these things.  Of course, respect, love, and understanding are some of
the primary reasons we're in a relationship.  But to be authentic and truly
satisfying, these things must be given freely, not insisted upon or coerced.
